\section{Professional Experience}

\subsection{Cardinal Operations, Algorithm Engineer (Operations
Research)}
\texttt{September 2018 - Present} \\
\textit{Large-scale MILP algorithm design for production planning} \\
\bullet\quad Developed a very large-scale (17m constraints and 19m
variables) planning model for a global ICT gaint to tackle difficulties
in delivery requirements. \\
\bullet\quad Designed an LP-based iterative procedure to decompose the
full problem including various pre and post processing techniques,
graph-based heuristics to deal with integral and hard features. The
model has been deployed and used in real production. \\
\bullet\quad Extended the model as a S\&OP and APS product tailored for
manufacturing industry. \\
\textit{Planning models for air-cargo operation} \\
\bullet\quad Implemented MILP, mixed integer SOCP programs for an
aircraft position assignment problem that optimizes allocations for
incoming cargo planes to minimize the total processing time needed for
air cargo transfers. \\
\bullet\quad Applied a geometric rounding scheme for the assignment
constraints to achieve a 10\% optimality gap comparable to 8\% gaps
obtained by mixed integer programs within 1 hr. \\
\subsection{RTBAsia, Data Scientist}
\texttt{September 2017- August 2018} \\
\textit{Machine learning models for advertising fraud detection} \\
\bullet\quad Designed online (streaming) and offline machine learning
pipelines for invalid traffic detection with implementation in Spark and
Kafka \\
\bullet\quad Researched on DL-based (CV + NLP) models to evaluate Ad
context (URL, for example) for digital marketing, and to protect brands
from unsafe, inappropriate, or incompatible content. \\
