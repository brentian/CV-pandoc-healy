appointment:
  - place: Cardinal Operations, Algorithm Engineer (Operations Research)
    date: September 2018 - Present
    items:
      - item: Large-scale MILP algorithm design for production planning
        slots:
          - slot: Developed a very large-scale (17m constraints and 19m variables) planning model for a global ICT gaint to tackle difficulties in delivery requirements.
          - slot: Designed an LP-based iterative procedure to decompose the full problem including various pre and post processing techniques, graph-based heuristics to deal with integral and hard features. The model has been deployed and used in real production.
          - slot: Extended the model as a S&OP and APS product tailored for manufacturing industry.

      - item: Planning models for air-cargo operation
        slots:
          - slot: Implemented MILP, mixed integer SOCP programs for an aircraft position assignment problem that optimizes allocations for incoming cargo planes to minimize the total processing time needed for air cargo transfers.
          - slot: Applied a geometric rounding scheme for the assignment constraints to achieve a 10% optimality gap comparable to 8% gaps obtained by mixed integer programs within 1 hr.

  - place: RTBAsia, Data Scientist
    date: September 2017- August 2018
    items:
      - item: Machine learning models for advertising fraud detection
        slots:
          - slot: Designed online (streaming) and offline machine learning pipelines for invalid traffic detection with implementation in Spark and Kafka
          - slot: Researched on DL-based (CV + NLP) models to evaluate Ad context (URL, for example) for digital marketing, and to protect brands from unsafe, inappropriate, or incompatible content.
